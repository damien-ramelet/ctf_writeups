### Challenge description

Among all the posts published by RÃ©information Lucide, the pictures are particularly important because, according to our sources, they were taken by the administrators of the group. Find the date and place when this picture was taken (in a 1 hour interval).

Flag format : PLAB{dd/mm/yyyy;11:00-12:00}

### Solution

This challenge was probably the one i most enjoyed. It's by far the most creative. Thanks Predictalab for this !

We are given this picture:

```
If you pass through the center of Paris, as I did three days ago, you'll be able to see this famous "artistic" installation. But do you know its true history?
In the 18th century, an influential secret group, the Illuminati, infiltrated Parisian artistic circles. They collaborated (and the word is apt) with renowned artists to disseminate coded messages through their works of art.
Each element of the columns is said to have a hidden meaning. The black and white stripes that characterize the columns represent the duality of the world we live in, where good and evil coexist. The varying heights of the columns form a cryptic pattern that links the various esoteric symbols scattered across Paris, indicating important places in the city that are linked to this occult group.
Yet more irrefutable proof of the Illuminati's infiltration of regal power.
```

We are asked to find out when this picture was tooked, including the hour !

Regarding the date, the author mentions he was in Paris three days ago, and the message was posted on 9th June. Which give us the 6th June.
But how are we supposed to get the hour ?

Our first instinct would be to check the EXIF data, let's give it a try:

Not so much of a help ! Of course, the author took care of removing any compromising data.

Looking again at the picture, we can see we have enhanced shadows. The higher pillars are almost 2 meters high. Of course, we could deduce the hour using the length of the shadows on the ground, but we don't have that information.
However, you might notice that the length shadows in the background are almost the size of the space between pillars. If this place is as famous as the author said, we might find those details online, and thus shadows sizes !

Using a reverse search engine, we quickly find that this place is named `Les Deux Plateaux` or `Colonnes de Buren`. It as his own wikipedia page.
The space every column is the same all over the place, 3,19 meters. We have the high of pillars, the size of the shadows, now we need their orientation regarding cardinal directions. 

By taking some pictures from slighly different angles, we can deduce the cardinal direction of the shadows:

![Several pictures of Buren Columns and a satellite view to deduce cardinal direction of the shadows](chronolocation_cardinal_direction.png)

Considering that the satellite view is north oriented (the north being the upper of the picture), and that the shadows are almost parallel to the gratings, their cardinal direction is almost plain west.
This means the sun was in the east. 

We have:

- The date, 6th June
- A precise location (Paris)
- The pillars high (~ 2 meters)
- The length of the shadows (~ 3 meters)
- Their orientation (Almost plain West)

We have all it takes to use a tool like SunCalc to compute the hour.

![Suncalc showing the shadows orientation we have on photos at 18h45](suncalc.png)

The only hour that match the shadows orientation and his length given the pillars size is around 18h !

So our interval is 18h00-19h00
